=== _段落_
[.lead]
段落不需要特别的格式，**直接**写就是了。
然后呢

=== _自然段_
这是普通段落

 开始至少空一格就成为自然段，同一个自然段里面的内容必须相邻，
 即不能隔空行。

 隔空行就是另一个自然段了。自然段文字是等宽字体，然后会保留空格和新行。
 例如    保留了前边的空格，
 然后这样，保留了换新行。

现在这里又是一个普通段落了。

//more

然后呢

Q & A
[qanda]
What is Asciidoctor?::
  An implementation of the AsciiDoc processor in Ruby.
What is the answer to the Ultimate Question?:: 42

Complex content in outline lists

* Every list item has at least one paragraph of content,
  which may be wrapped, even using a hanging indent.
+
Additional paragraphs or blocks are adjoined by putting
a list continuation on a line adjacent to both blocks.
+
list continuation:: a plus sign (`{plus}`) on a line by itself

* A literal paragraph does not require a list continuation.

 $ gem install asciidoctor

* AsciiDoc lists may contain any complex content.
