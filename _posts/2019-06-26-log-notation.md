The notation  $x = \ln y$  is a shorthand for the *natural logarithm* to the base $e$:  $x = \log_{e} y$ . This notation is used throughout mathematics, science, and engineering.

The shorthand notation  $x = \log y$  is sometimes used when the base $b$ remains fixed and is understood from the context. The "understood" base, however, can vary from place to place:

  - $x = \log y$  often means  $x = \ln y$  in **mathematics** texts.

  - $x = \log y$  often means  $x = \lg y$  in **science and engineering** texts.

  - $x = \log y$  often means  $x = \log_{2} y$  in **computer science** texts.

Be careful when reading or using  $x = \log y$ .<!--more-->
