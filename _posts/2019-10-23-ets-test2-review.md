**2.**Given:  
```java
package loops;
public class JustLooping {
    private int j;
    void showJ(){
        while(j<=5){
            for(int j=1; j <= 5;){
                System.out.print(j+" ");
                j++;
            }
            j++;
        }
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new JustLooping().showJ();
    }
}
```
What is the result?  
**You had to select 1 option** <!--more-->

- [ ] It will not compile.  
- [ ] It will print 1 2 3 4 5 five times.  
- [ ] It will print 1 3 5 five times.  
- [ ] It will print 1 2 3 4 5 once.  
- [x] It will print 1 2 3 4 5 six times.  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  2

The point to note here is that the `j` in for loop is different from the instance member `j`. Therefore, `j++` occuring in the `for` loop doesn't affect the while loop. The `for` loop prints 1 2 3 4 5.  
The while loop runs `for` the values 0 to 5 i.e. 6 iterations. Thus, 1 2 3 4 5 is printed 6 times. Note that after the end of the while loop the value of `j` is 6.

**6.**Given:  
```java
//in file Movable.java
package p1;
public interface Movable {
  int location = 0;
  void move(int by);
  public void moveBack(int by);
}

//in file Donkey.java
package p2;
import p1.Movable;
public class Donkey implements Movable{
    int location = 200;
    public void move(int by) {
        location = location+by;
    }
    public void moveBack(int by) {
        location = location-by;
    }
}

//in file TestClass.java
package px;
import p1.Movable;
import p2.Donkey;
public class TestClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Movable m = new Donkey();
        m.move(10);
        m.moveBack(20);
        System.out.println(m.location);
    }
}
```
Identify the correct statement(s).  
**You had to select 1 option**
- [ ] Donkey.java will not compile.  
- [ ] TestClass.java will not compile.  
- [ ] Movable.java will not compile.  
- [ ] It will print 190 when TestClass is run.  
- [x] It will print 0 when TestClass is run.  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  6

There is no problem with the code. All variables in an interface are implicitly `public`, `static`, and `final`. All methods in an interface are `public`.  
There is no need to define them so explicitly. Therefore, the `location` variable in `Movable` is `public` and `static` and the `move()` method is `public`.  
Now, when you call `m.move(10)` and `m.moveBack(20)`, the instance member `location` of `Donkey` is updated to 190 because¬†¬†the reference `m` refers to a `Donkey` at run time and so `move` and `moveBack` methods of `Donkey` are invoked at runtime. However, when you print `m.location`, it is the Movable's `location` (which is never updated) that is printed.

**8.**What will be the result of trying to compile and execute the following program?
```java
public class TestClass{
   public static void main(String args[] ){
      int i = 0 ;
      int[] iA = {10, 20} ;
      iA[i] = i = 30 ;
      System.out.println(""+ iA[ 0 ] + " " + iA[ 1 ] + "  "+i) ;
    }
}
```
**You had to select 1 options**
- [ ] It will throw `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` at Runtime  
- [ ] Compile time Error.  
- [ ] It will print 10 20 30  
- [x] It will print 30 20 30  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  8

The statement `iA[i] = i = 30;` will be processed as follows:  
`iA[i] = i = 30;` üëâ `iA[0] = i = 30;`  üëâ  `i = 30; iA[0] = i ;` üëâ  `iA[0] = 30;`  

Here is what JLS says on this:  
**1** Evaluate Left-Hand Operand First  
**2** Evaluate Operands before Operation  
**3** Evaluation Respects Parentheses and Precedence  
**4** Argument Lists are Evaluated Left-to-Right  

For Arrays: First, the dimension expressions are evaluated, left-to-right. If any of the expression evaluations completes abruptly, the expressions to the right of it are not evaluated.  

---

**11.**Consider the following class :  
```java
public class Test{
   public static void main(String[] args){
      if (args[0].equals("open"))
         if (args[1].equals("someone"))
            System.out.println("Hello!");
      else System.out.println("Go away "+ args[1]);
    }
}
```
Which of the following statements are true if the above program is run with the command line :  
`java Test closed`  
**You had to select 1 options**
- [ ] It will throw `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` at runtime.  
- [x] It will end without exceptions and will print nothing.  
- [ ] It will print `Go away`  
- [ ] It will print `Go away` and then will throw `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  
- [ ] None of the above.  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  11

As in C and C++, the Java `if` statement suffers from the so-called "dangling `else` problem," The problem is that both the outer `if` statement and the inner `if` statement might conceivably own the `else` clause. In this example, one might be tempted to assume that the programmer intended the `else` clause to belong to the outer `if` statement.  

The Java language, like C and C++ and many languages before them, arbitrarily decree that an `else` clause belongs to the innermost `if` so as the first `if()` condition fails (`args[0]` not being "open") there is no `else` associated to execute. So, the program does nothing. The else actually is associated with the second `if`.  
So had the command line been :  
`java Test open`, it would have executed the second `if` and thrown `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.  
If the command line had been:  
`java Test open xyz`, it would execute the else part(which is associated with the second `if`) and would have printed "Go away xyz".

---

**14.**Which of the following code snippets will compile without any errors?  
(Assume that the statement `int x = 0;` exists prior to the statements below.)  
**You had to select 3 options**

- [ ] `while (false) { x=3; }`  
- [x] `if (false) { x=3; }`  
- [x] `do{ x = 3; } while(false);`  
- [x] `for( int i = 0; i< 0; i++) x = 3;`  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  14

`while (false) { x=3; }` is a compile-time error because the statement `x=3;` is not reachable;  
Similarly, `for( int i = 0; false; i++) x = 3;` is also a compile time error because `x = 3;` is unreachable.  

In `if(false){ x=3; }`, although the body of the condition is unreachable, this is not an error because the JLS explicitly defines this as an exception to the rule. It allows this construct to support optimizations through the conditional compilation. For example,  
`if(DEBUG){ System.out.println("beginning task 1"); }`  
Here, the `DEBUG` variable can be set to false in the code while generating the production version of the class file, which will allow the compiler to optimize the code by removing the whole if statement entirely from the class file.  

---

**20.**Given the following code, which of these statements are true?  
```java
class TestClass{
   public static void main(String args[]){
      int k = 0;
      int m = 0;
      for ( int i = 0; i <= 3; i++){
         k++;
         if ( i == 2){
            // line 1
         }
         m++;
      }
      System.out.println( k + ", " + m );
   }
}
```
**You had to select 3 options**
- [x] It will print 3, 2 when line 1 is replaced by `break;`  
- [ ] It will print 3, 2 when line 1 is replaced by `continue`.  
- [x] It will print 4, 3 when line 1 is replaced by `continue`.  
- [ ] It will print 4, 4 when line 1 is replaced by `i = m++;`  
- [x] It will print 3, 3 when line 1 is replaced by `i = 4;`  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  20

This is a simple loop. All you need to do is execute each statement in your head. For example, if line 1 is replaced by `break`:  

> ‚ë† k=0, m=0  
> ‚ë° iteration 1: i=0  
>    ‚á® k = 1  
>    ‚á® i == 2 is false  
>    ‚á® m = 1  
> ‚ë¢ iteration 2: i = 1  
>    ‚á® k=2  
>    ‚á® i==2 is false  
>    ‚á® m = 2  
> ‚ë£ iteration 3: i = 2  
>    ‚á® k=3  
>    ‚á® i==2 is true  
>    ‚á® break  
> ‚ë§ print 3, 2

**25.**Which of these statements are true?  
**You had to select 2 options**
- [ ] A static method can call other non-static methods in the same class by using the 'this' keyword.  
- [x] A calss may contain both static and non-static variables and both static and non-static methods.  
- [x] Each object of a class has its own copy of each non-static member variable.  
- [ ] Instance methods of a class has it own copy of each non-static member variable.  
- [ ] Instance methods may access local variables of static methods.  
- [ ] All methods in a class are implicitly passed a 'this' parameter when called.  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  25

'this' is assigned a reference to the current object automatically by the JVM. Thus, within an instance method `foo`, calling `this.foo();` is same as calling `foo();`  
Since there is no current object available for a static method, 'this' reference is not available in static methods and therefore it can only be used within instance methods. For the same reason, static methods cannot access non static fields or methods of that class directly i.e. without a reference to an instance of that class.  
Note : you can't reassign 'this' like this: `this = new Object();`  

---

**28.**Which of the following comparisons will yield false?  
**You had to select 3 options**
- [ ] `Boolean.parseBoolean("true") == true`  
- [x] `Boolean.parseBoolean("TrUe") == new Boolean(null);`  
- [x] `new Boolean("TrUe") == new Boolean(true);`  
- [ ] `new Boolean() == false;`  
- [ ] `new Boolean("true") == Boolean.TRUE`  
- [x] `new Boolean("no") == false;`  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  28

**You need to remember the following points about `Boolean`:**  
**1.** `Boolean` class has two constructors - `Boolean(String)` and `Boolean(boolean)` The `String` constructor allocates a `Boolean` object representing the value `true` if the string argument is not `null` and is equal, ignoring case, to the string "true". Otherwise, allocate a `Boolean` object representing the value `false`. Examples: `new Boolean("True")` produces a `Boolean` object that represents `true`. `new Boolean("yes")` produces a `Boolean` object that represents `false`.
The `boolean` constructor is self explanatory.  
**2.** `Boolean` class has two static helper methods for creating booleans - `parseBoolean` and `valueOf`. `Boolean.parseBoolean(String )` method returns a primitive `boolean` and not a `Boolean` object (Note - Same is with the case with other parseXXX methods such as `Integer.parseInt` - they return primitives and not objects). The `boolean` returned represents the value `true` if the string argument is not null and is equal, ignoring case, to the string "true".  
`Boolean.valueOf(String )` and its overloaded `Boolean.valueOf(boolean )` version, on the other hand, work similarly but return a reference to either `Boolean.TRUE` or `Boolean.FALSE` wrapper objects. Observe that they dont create a new `Boolean` object but just return the static constants `TRUE` or `FALSE` defined in `Boolean` class.  
**3.** When you use the equality operator ( `==` ) with booleans, if exactly one of the operands is a `Boolean` wrapper, it is first unboxed into a `boolean` primitive and then the two are compared (JLS 15.21.2). If both are `Boolean` wrappers, then their references are compared just like in the case of other objects. Thus, `new Boolean("true") == new Boolean("true")` is `false`, but `new Boolean("true") == Boolean.parseBoolean("true")` is true.

**29.**Identify the valid for loop constructs assuming the following declarations:  
```java
Object o = null;
Collection c = //valid collection object.
int[][] ia = //valid array
```
**You had to select 2 options**
 - [ ] `for(o : c){ }`  
   
    > Cannot use an existing/predefined variable in the variable declaration part.  
 - [x] `for(final Object o2 :c){ }`  
   
    > final is the only modifier (excluding annotations) that is allowed here.  
 - [ ] `for(int i : ia) { }`  
   
    > Each element of ia is itself an array. Thus, they cannot be assigned to an `int`.  
 - [ ] `for(Iterator it : c.iterator()){ }`  
    > `c.iterator()` does not return any Collection. Note that the following would have been valid:  
    > `Collection<Iterator> c` = //some collection that contains Iterator objects  
    > `for(Iterator it : c){ }`  
 - [x] `for(int i : ia[0]){ }`  
   
    > Since `ia[0]` is an array of ints, this is valid. (It may throw a `NullPointerException` or `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` at runtime if `ia` is not appropriately initialized.)  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  29

**33.**Which of these assignments are valid?  
**You had to select 3 options**
- [x] `short s = 12;`  
  
    > This is valid since 12 can fit into a short and an implicit narrowing conversion can occur.  
- [x] `long g = 012;`  
  
    > 012 is a valid octal number.  
- [ ] `int i = (int) false;`  
  
    > Values of type boolean cannot be converted to any other types.  
- [x] `float f = -123;`  
  
    > Implicit widening conversion will occur in this case.  
- [ ] `float d = 0 * 1.5;`  
  
    > double cannot be implicitly narrowed to a float even though the value is representable by a float.  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  33
Note that  
`float d = 0 * 1.5f;` and `float d = 0 * (float)1.5;` are OK  
An implicit narrowing primitive conversion may be used if all of the following conditions are satisfied:  
**1.** The expression is a compile time constant expression of type `byte`, `char`, `short`, or `int`.  
**2.** The type of the variable is `byte`, `short`, or `char`.  
**3.** The value of the expression (which is known at compile time, because it is a constant expression) is representable in the type of the variable.  
Note that implicit narrowing conversion does not apply to `long` or `double`. So, `char ch = 30L;` will fail even though 30 is representable in `char`.  

---

**44.**What will the following code print?  
```java
public class TestClass{
        int x = 5;
        int getX(){ return x; }

        public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception{
            TestClass tc = new TestClass();
            tc.looper();
            System.out.println(tc.x);
        }
        
        public void looper(){
            int x = 0;
            while( (x = getX()) != 0 ){
                for(int m = 10; m>=0; m--){
                    x = m;
                }
            }
            
       }     
}
```
**You had to select 1 option**
- [ ] It will not compile.  
- [ ] It will throw an exception at runtime.  
- [ ] It will print 0.  
- [ ] It will print 5.  
- [x] None of these.  
    
    > This program will compile and run but will never terminate.  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  44
Note that `looper()` declares an automatic variable `x`, which **shadows** the instance variable `x`. So when `x = m;` is executed, it is the local variable `x` that is changed not the instance field `x`. So `getX()` never returns 0. If you remove `int x = 0;` from `looper()`, it will print 0 and end.  

---

**48.**What will the following program print?  
```java
class Test{
   public static void main(String args[]){
      int var = 20, i=0;
      do{
         while(true){
         if( i++ > var) break;
         }
      }while(i<var--);
      System.out.println(var);
   }
}
```
**You had to select 1 option**  
- [x] 19  
- [ ] 20  
- [ ] 21  
- [ ] 22  
- [ ] It will enter an infinite loop.  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  48
When the first iteration of outer do-while loop starts, `var` is 20. Now, the inner loop executes till `i` becomes 21.
Now, the condition for outer do-while is checked, `while( 22 < 20 )`, [`i` is 22 because of the last `i++>var` check], thereby making `var` 19. And as the condition is `false`, the outer loop also ends.
So, 19 is printed.  

---

**56.**Consider the following code:  
```java
class A{
   A() {  print();   }
   void print() { System.out.println("A"); }
}
class B extends A{
   int i =   4;
   public static void main(String[] args){
      A a = new B();
      a.print();
   }
   void print() { System.out.println(i); }
}
```
What will be the output when class B is run ?  
**You had to select 1 option**
- [ ] It will print A, 4  
- [ ] It will print A, A  
- [x] It will print 0, 4  
- [ ] It will print 4, 4  
- [ ] None of the above.  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  56
Note that method `print()` is overridden in class `B`. Due to polymorphism, the method to be executed is selected depending on the class of the actual object.  
Here, when an object of class `B` is created, first `B`'s default constructor (which is not visible in the code but is automatically provided by the compiler because `B` does not define any constructor explicitly) is called. The first line of this constructor is a call to `super()`, which invokes `A`'s constructor. `A`'s constructor in turn calls `print()`. Now, print is a non-private instance method and is therefore polymorphic, which means, the selection of the method to be executed depends on the class of actual object on which it is invoked. Here, since the class of actual object is `B`, `B`'s print is selected instead of `A`'s print. At this point of time, variable `i` has not been initialized (because we are still in the middle of initializing `A`), so its default value i.e. 0 is printed.  
Finally, 4 is printed.  

---

**58.**What will be the result of attempting to compile and run the following program?  
```java
class TestClass{
   public static void main(String args[]){
      int i = 0;
      loop :         // 1
      {
         System.out.println("Loop Lable line");
         try{
            for (  ;  true ;  i++ ){
               if( i >5) break loop;       // 2
            }
         }
         catch(Exception e){
            System.out.println("Exception in loop.");
         }
         finally{
            System.out.println("In Finally");      // 3
         }
      }
   }
}
```
**You had to select 1 option**
- [ ] Compilation error at line 1 as this is an invalid syntax for defining a label.  
    
    > You can apply a label to any code block or a block level statement (such as a for statement) but **not** to declarations. For example: `loopX : int i = 10;`  
- [ ] Compilation error at line 2 as 'loop' is not visible here.  
- [x] No compilation error and line 3 will be executed.  
    
    > Even if the `break` takes the control out of the block, the `finally` clause will be executed.  
- [ ] No compilation error and line 3 will NOT be executed.  
- [ ] Only the line with the label loop will be printed.  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  58
A `break` without a label breaks the current loop (i.e. no iterations any more) and a `break` with a label tries to pass the control to the given label. 'Tries to' means that if the `break` is in a `try` block and the `try` block has a `finally` clause associated with it then it will be executed.

**65.**Consider the following code snippet:  
```java
XXXX m ;
//other code
  switch( m ){
     case 32  : System.out.println("32");   break;
     case 64  : System.out.println("64");   break;
     case 128 : System.out.println("128");  break;
  }
```
What type can 'm' be of so that the above code compiles and runs as expected ?  
**You had to select 3 options**
- [x] `int m;`  
    
    > `m` can hold all the case values.  
- [ ] `long m;`  
    
    > long, `float`, `double`, and `boolean` can never be used as a `switch` variable.  
- [x] `char m;`  
    
    > `m` can hold all the case values.  
- [ ] `byte m;`  
    
    > `m` will not be able to hold 128. a `byte`'s range is -128 to 127.  
- [x] `short m;`  
    
    > `m` can hold all the case values.  

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  65
**Here are the rules for a switch statement:**  
**1.** Only `String`, `byte`, `char`, `short`, `int`, (and their wrapper classes `Byte`, `Character`, `Short`, and `Integer`), and *enums* can be used as types of a `switch` variable. (`String` is allowed only since Java 7).  
**2.** The case constants must be assignable to the `switch` variable. For example, if your `switch` variable is of class `String`, your case labels must use Strings as well.  
**3.** The `switch` variable must be **big enough** to hold all the case constants. For example, if the `switch` variable is of type `char`, then none of the case constants can be greater than 65535 because a `char`'s range is from 0 to 65535.  
**4.**  All case labels should be **COMPILE TIME CONSTANTS**.  
**5.** No two of the case constant expressions associated with a `switch` statement may have the same value.  
**6.** At most one `default` label may be associated with the same `switch` statement.

**69.**Consider the following code:  
```java
interface Flyer{ String getName(); }

class Bird implements Flyer{
    public String name;
    public Bird(String name){
        this.name = name;
    }
    public String getName(){ return name; }
}

class Eagle extends Bird {
    public Eagle(String name){
        super(name);
    }
}

public class TestClass {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Flyer f = new Eagle("American Bald Eagle");
        //PRINT NAME HERE
   }
}
```
Which of the following lines of code will print the name of the Eagle object?  
**You had to select 3 options**
- [ ] `System.out.println(f.name);`  
- [x] `System.out.println(f.getName());`  
- [x] `System.out.println(((Eagle)f).name);`  
- [x] `System.out.println(((Bird)f).getName());`  
- [ ] `System.out.println(Eagle.name);`  
    
    > `name` is not a `static` field in class `Eagle`.  
- [ ] `System.out.println(Eagle.getName(f));`

##### ‚ú®**Explanation**  69
While accessing a method or variable, the compiler will only allow you to access a method or variable that is visible through the class of the reference.  
When you try to use `f.name`, the class of the reference `f` is `Flyer` and `Flyer` has no field named "`name`", thus, it will not compile. But when you cast `f` to `Bird` (or `Eagle`), the compiler sees that the class `Bird` (or `Eagle`, because `Eagle` inherits from `Bird`) does have a field named "`name`" so `((Eagle)f).name` or `((Bird)f).name` will work fine.  
`f.getName()` will work because `Flyer` does have a `getName()` method.
